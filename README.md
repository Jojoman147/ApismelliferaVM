# ApisVM
This code is designed to evaluate bee wings according to the DAWINO methodology using 18 points on the forewing of Apis mellifera.(Version 1.0)
This manual will guide you step-by-step on how to use the script for analyzing the front (Frontwing) and back (Backwing) wings, including calibration, saving results, and performing analyses.
User manual is in Documentation file
Patterns for wing dot placement are in the Images file. 
Frontwing for version 2.jpg is an image showing the points for the upcoming version.
Posterior probability in this version is calculated only for Slovak lines of 6 breeders.  The standards are obtained from an ongoing mapping study of breeding lines (only one year 2023).

- Version 1.0.1: updated buttons for analysis posterior probability of Apis mellifera. 
- Windows app ApisVM still contains .exe file for 1.0 version.
# Upcoming update:
1. Calculation of Posterior probability for Apis mellifera acording Uzunov et al., 2009.
2. Adjustment of the marked points on the forewing according to the picture Frontwing for version 2.jpg
