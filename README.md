# ApisVM
This code is designed to evaluate bee wings according to the DAWINO methodology using 18 points on the forewing of Apis mellifera.
This manual will guide you step-by-step on how to use the script for analyzing the front (Frontwing) and back (Backwing) wings, including calibration, saving results, and performing analyses.
User manual is in Documentation file
Patterns for wing dot placement are in the Images file. 
Frontwing for version 2.jpg is an image showing the points for the upcoming version.
Posterior propability in this version is calculated only for Slovak lines of 6 breeders.  The standards are obtained from an ongoing mapping study of breeding lines (only one year 2023). See figure Map of Slovak breeding lines.
# Upcoming update:
1. Calculation of Posterior propability for Apis mellifera.
2. Adjustment of the marked points on the forewing according to the picture Frontwing for version 2.jpg
